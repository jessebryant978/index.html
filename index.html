    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
    <p>I'm motivated and flexible in different areas. Specificly in the tech area: front-end development and dApps.
        besides that I like to analyse things to get solutions out of scenario's that can play out in the future.
        For example, I like to analyse ceratin crypto's/stocks/commodities to get a position in the market early
        to sell those assets at a higher price. My aim is to use my skills/expertise to drive value. I constantly 
        looking for growth and innovation.
